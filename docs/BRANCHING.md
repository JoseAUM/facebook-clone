# Branching Strategy

## Primary Branches

The following branches will exist:

- `main` (Deployment)
- `development` (Dev)

## Naming Conventions

- `feature/{brief-description}`: for new features
- `bug/{brief-description}`: for a bug

## Best Practices

- Avoid having branches exist for an extended period of time; they should be PR'ed and merged without too many changes.
- Delete stale branches regularly.
